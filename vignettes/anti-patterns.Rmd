When I first started to utilize the ``site.R`` script, I found it helpful to understand which elements exists and how they can and cannot be used to create a website. This tutorial is aimed to give the users a slightly deeper understanding of the package by eliminating implicit knowledge. If you haven't already, I would first read the [quick-start guide](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/community/articles/quickstart-site.html) before continuing with this tutorial.


Attributes:
---
- <span style="color:blue">__Singleton__</span>: A singleton is an element that can only occur _once_ in a site. For example, you _cannot_ create multiple navbars

Colors:
---
- <span style="color:red">__Red__</span>: Causes an error
- <span style="color:orange">__Orange__</span>: Does not cause an error, but require implicit knowledge

Page Elements:
---
- <span style="color:blue">__page_head__</span>: 
  - This element seems to be replaced by the last time it is called. In other words, if you call this element twice, <span style="color:orange">only the latest call is preserved</span>
- <span style="color:blue">__page_menu__</span>: 
  - When you create multiple menus, the last one ends up on the top
  - If you make multiple ``page_menu``s, <span style="color:red">but the second one would overlap with the first one, making you unable to close the second one</span>
- <span style="color:blue">__page_navbar__</span>: 
  - If you call this multiple times, <span style="color:orange"> only the latest call would be the one implemented </span> 
  - You can call the element anywhere inside ``site.R``
- <span style="color:blue">__page_panel__ (_conditionally-singleton_) </span>:
  - Right now, if you call a ``page_panel`` with ``position=Left`` argument and a ``page_menu`` element, in first instance of rendering, <span style="color:orange"> the panel would first push the menu to the right of it, before having it recede to overlap it</span>
  - This element is _singleton_ by position (i.e., you cannot create two panels in the same position without it overlapping)
- __page_section__:
  - You can use this element to create any number of additional sections going down
- __page_tabgroup__:
  - If you follow the example, you realize that the ``output_map()`` is a singleton, and <span style="color:red"> calling multiple maps, all but the first one appears</span>
- __page_text__:
  - Adds html text to the site directly
