\description{
Make a \code{measure_info.json} file, or add measure entries to an existing one.

\section{Measure Entries}{

Measure entries are named by the full variable name with any of these entries (if \code{strict}):
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{measure}}: Name of the measure.
\item \strong{\code{full_name}}: Full name of the measure, which is also the name of the entry.
\item \strong{\code{short_name}}: Shortest possible display name.
\item \strong{\code{long_name}}: Longer display name.
\item \strong{\code{category}}: Arbitrary category for the measure.
\item \strong{\code{short_description}}: Shortest possible description.
\item \strong{\code{long_description}}: Complete description.
\item \strong{\code{statement}}: String with dynamic references to entity features
(e.g., \code{"measure value = {value}"}). References can include:
\itemize{
\item \code{value}: Value of a currently displaying variable at a current time.
\item \code{region_name}: Alias of \code{feature.name}.
\item \code{feature.<entry>}: An entity feature, coming from \code{entity_info.json} or GeoJSON properties.
All entities have at least \code{name} and \code{id} entries (e.g., \code{"{feature.id}"}).
\item \code{variables.<entry>}: A variable feature such as \code{name} which is the same as
\code{full_name} (e.g., \code{"{variables.name}"}).
\item \code{data.<variable>}: The value of another variable at a current time (e.g., \code{"{data.variable_a}"}).
}
\item \strong{\code{type}}: Type of the measure's value. Recognized types are displayed in a special way:
\itemize{
\item \code{year} or \code{integer} show as entered (usually as whole numbers). Other numeric
types are rounded to show a set number of digits.
\item \code{percent} shows as \code{{value}\%}.
\item \code{minutes} shows as \code{{value} minutes}.
\item \code{dollar} shows as \code{${value}}.
\item \code{internet speed} shows as \code{{value} MB/s}.
}
\item \strong{\code{sources}}: A list or list of list containing source information, including any of these entries:
\itemize{
\item \code{name}: Name of the source (such as an organization name).
\item \code{url}: General URL of the source (such as an organization's website).
\item \code{location}: More specific description of the source (such as a the name of a particular data product).
\item \code{location_url}: More direct URL to the resource (such as a page listing data products).
\item \code{date_accessed}: Date of retrieval (arbitrary format).
}
\item \strong{\code{citations}}: A vector of reference ids (the names of \code{reference} entries; e.g., \code{c("ref1", "ref3")}).
\item \strong{\code{layer}}: A list specifying an \code{\link{output_map}} overlay:
\itemize{
\item \code{source} (required): A URL to a GeoJSON file, or a list with a \code{url} and \code{time} entry, where
\code{time} conditions the display of the layer on the current selected time. Alternative to a list that specifies time,
the URL can include a dynamic reference to time, if the time values correspond to a component of the URL
(e.g., \code{"https://example.com/{time}/points.geojson"}).
\item \code{filter}: A list or list of lists specifying how the elements of the layer should be filtered for this variable:
\itemize{
\item \code{feature}: Name of the layer's property to filter on.
\item \code{operator}: Operator to filter by (e.g., \code{"="} or \code{"!="}).
\item \code{value}: Value to filter by.
}
}
}
}

\section{Reference Entries}{

Reference entries can be included in a \code{_references} entry, and should have names corresponding to
those included in any of the measures' \code{citation} entries. These can include any of these entries:
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{id}}: The reference id, same as the entry name.
\item \strong{\code{author}}: A list or list of lists specifying one or more authors. These can include
entries for \code{given} and \code{family} names.
\item \strong{\code{year}}: Year of the publication.
\item \strong{\code{title}}: Title of the publication.
\item \strong{\code{journal}}: Journal in which the publication appears.
\item \strong{\code{volume}}: Volume number of the journal.
\item \strong{\code{page}}: Page number of the journal.
\item \strong{\code{doi}}: Digital Object Identifier, from which a link is made (\code{https://doi.org/{doi}}).
\item \strong{\code{version}}: Version number of software.
\item \strong{\code{url}}: Link to the publication, alternative to a DOI.
